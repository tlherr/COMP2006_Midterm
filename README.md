Develop an application that performs the following:
-	Hardcode your first name, last name, and student number into 3 strings.  	 (1 mark)
-	Concatenate your first + last + (ID) to display on the output as seen in the sample (2 mark)
-	Loop continuously to allow the user to make a selection (#4 exits)		  (1 mark)
-	Use a switch statement to determine the user input				  (1 mark)
-	If the user input is not understood, re-poll the user to try again			  (1 mark)
-	Create 5 functions called: RomanToBase10, Base10ToRoman, RomanAddition;       (1 mark) RemoveSubstractives, AddSubstractives (these can be re-used for multiple functions)
-	Once the user has made the selection call the respective function above to perform the below type of examples. Background is provided along with working samples. (6 marks per operation (ie. Option 1, 2, or 3) – full marks will be awarded if function is completed and substractives is integrated, partial marks will be awarded for core logic without substractive integration)
